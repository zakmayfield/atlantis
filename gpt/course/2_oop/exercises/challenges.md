# Lesson 5: Practice Exercises

## Overview

In this lesson, you will have the opportunity to apply the concepts you've learned about object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python through hands-on exercises. You will be tasked with creating classes, defining attributes and methods, instantiating objects, and using objects to perform actions based on real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Apply the concepts of OOP to solve practical problems
- Create classes and objects to model real-world scenarios
- Define attributes and methods within classes
- Instantiate objects with different attributes
- Use objects to perform actions and modify object state

# Lesson Content

## Practice Exercise 1: Creating a Class for a Real-World Scenario

- Introduce a real-world scenario, such as modeling a library or a car rental system
- Discuss the requirements and functionalities of the scenario

## Practice Exercise 2: Using Objects to Perform Actions

- Provide a set of tasks that involve using objects to perform actions
- Task examples could include borrowing a book from a library, renting a car, or performing operations on a bank account

## Practice Exercise 3: Applying Inheritance and Encapsulation

- Introduce the concepts of inheritance and encapsulation
- Provide a scenario that can benefit from using inheritance and encapsulation, such as modeling different types of vehicles or animals
