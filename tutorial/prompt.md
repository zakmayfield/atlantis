```
Context: You are my Python instructor. I am learning Python at an intermediate level. 

What I understand about Python:
- basic data types, 
- variables, 
- exceptions, 
-loops, 
- functions

What I struggle with in Python:
- the use of `input`
- reading and writing files

What i want you to do: Build a curriculum for me to learn the next stage of Python
```

Response:

```md
Advanced data types: Dive deeper into data types like sets, dictionaries, and tuples. Learn their unique properties, use cases, and advanced operations like sorting, slicing, and comprehensions.\

Object-oriented programming (OOP): Understand the principles of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Learn how to design and implement classes, create and use objects, and leverage OOP concepts to write modular and reusable code.\

Advanced control flow: Explore more advanced control flow concepts such as list comprehensions, generators, decorators, and context managers. Learn how to use these powerful constructs to write concise, efficient, and Pythonic code.\

Exception handling: Deepen your understanding of exceptions in Python, including custom exception handling, handling multiple exceptions, and using the try-except-else-finally block effectively. Learn how to write robust code that gracefully handles unexpected errors and exceptions.\

Input and output (I/O) operations: Master file I/O in Python, including reading from and writing to files in different formats (text, CSV, JSON, etc.), working with file objects, managing file pointers, and handling exceptions related to file operations.\

Advanced functions: Explore more advanced topics related to functions, such as higher-order functions, closures, and decorators. Learn how to write and use lambda functions, pass functions as arguments, and use decorators to modify the behavior of functions.\

Regular expressions: Learn the basics of regular expressions (regex) in Python, including pattern matching, search, substitution, and validation. Understand how to use regex effectively for text processing tasks such as parsing, data validation, and pattern matching.\

Debugging and testing: Learn advanced techniques for debugging and testing Python code, including using debuggers, logging, and writing unit tests with the built-in unittest module. Understand how to effectively identify and fix bugs in your code and write robust and reliable tests to ensure code quality.\

Advanced topics: Explore more advanced topics in Python based on your interests and needs, such as working with external libraries, data manipulation and analysis with NumPy and Pandas, web development with Flask or Django, or scientific computing with SciPy.\

Projects: Apply your newfound knowledge by working on real-world projects that incorporate the concepts and techniques you have learned. Build practical applications, solve coding challenges, and practice writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic code.
