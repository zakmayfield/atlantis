# The Advanced Python's Guide to the Galaxy.

*TLDR: Advanced Python tutorial generated by ChatGPT. While creating this tutorial I will be simlutaneously self learning Python based on the same curriculum.*

## Intro.

As a developer, I found myself grappling with the question of how to boost my productivity **utilizing ChatGPT** and learn Python more efficiently. What if I could leverage the power of ChatGPT to **create my own advanced Python bootcamp**?

By harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT, I envisioned a Python bootcamp that could offer a one-of-a-kind learning experience. The curriculum generated by ChatGPT would be tailored to the needs of learners, providing a personalized and adaptive learning journey. With the ability to generate up-to-date content, practical examples, and interactive exercises, this "bootcamp" could offer a cutting-edge learning experience for Python enthusiasts.

I recognize that Python is a leading programming language in many fields. As the demand for AI tech skills continue to soar, it's more important than ever to have effective and innovative ways of growing your skills as a developer. A bootcamp powered by ChatGPT could be a timely and relevant solution in the rapidly evolving technology landscape, **especially in the sonic boom of AI startups**.

## How it's gonna work.

In this "tutorial", I'll be sharing my journey of creating a Python "promptcamp" (a ChatGPT bootcamp based on user prompts) using ChatGPT, from conceptualization to implementation. We'll explore the benefits of leveraging ChatGPT for generating a Python "bootcamp" curriculum, discuss potential challenges, and delve into the outcomes and insights gained from this unique approach to learning Python.

## Current Python knowledge.

This tutorial is assuming you are familiar with the basics of Python, meaning you understand `basic data types`, `variables`, `exceptions`, `loops`, and `functions`.

I'm creating this tutorial with minimal Python knowledge, I'm aware of the basics mentioned earlier.

My background is in JavaScript development, specifically front end, utilizing React. I'm excited to see the similarities between JavaScript & Python.

## To note.

* Most, if not all, of this tutorial will be generated by ChatGPT.
* The guardrails of the ChatGPT prompt were to focus on an intermediate learner who understands basic Python. ChatGPT was instructed to build a curriculum based on this prompt.
